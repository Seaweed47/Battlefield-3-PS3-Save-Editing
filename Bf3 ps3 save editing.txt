So we follow this guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDFEXbtOSjA
But no need for battlefield 4 checksum fixer anymore

Download this text file and upload it to chatgpt
https://github.com/Seaweed47/Battlefield-3-PS3-Save-Editing/blob/main/Bf3%20checksum%20gpt.txt

Then upload your edited USR-DATA to chatgpt
Now tell chatgpt "Use the code from the text file on the USR-DATA file"

It will tell you something like CRC = 0xE9BDE242
Then in the Hex editor you edit in E9 BD E2 42 at the start of the first row
You do that for the specific CRC it tells you

For example, this 90 FOV save has CRC = 0x25A4B630 or 25 A4 B6 30 at the start of the first row.
