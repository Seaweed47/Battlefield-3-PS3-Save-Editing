Click green Code button and download as zip.

So we follow this guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDFEXbtOSjA
But no need for battlefield 4 checksum fixer anymore.

Download this text file and upload it to chatgpt.
https://github.com/Seaweed47/Battlefield-3-PS3-Save-Editing/blob/main/Bf3_checksum_gpt.txt

Then upload your edited USR-DATA to chatgpt.
Now tell chatgpt "Use the code from the text file on the USR-DATA file".

It will tell you something like CRC = 0xE9BDE242
Then in the Hex editor you edit in E9 BD E2 42 at the start of the first row.
You do that for the specific CRC it tells you.

For example, this 90 FOV save has CRC = 0x25A4B630 or 25 A4 B6 30 at the start of the first row.

It is also possible to find the checksums offline.
First install python from the microsoft store.

Download this python file and move it to a new folder.
https://github.com/Seaweed47/Battlefield-3-PS3-Save-Editing/blob/main/Bf3_checksum_gpt.py
Copy your edited USR-DATA to the same folder as the python file.

Hold shift and right-click the white background within the folder.
Click Open PowerShell window here.
Within Windows PowerShell use the following command: 
python ./Bf3_checksum_gpt.py USR-DATA
It will then tell you the CRC of the USR-DATA.
