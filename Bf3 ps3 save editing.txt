Click green Code button and download as zip.

So we follow this guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDFEXbtOSjA
But no need for battlefield 4 checksum fixer anymore.

Download this text file and upload it to chatgpt.
https://github.com/Seaweed47/Battlefield-3-PS3-Save-Editing/blob/main/Bf3_checksum.txt

Then upload your edited USR-DATA to chatgpt.
Now tell chatgpt "Use the code from the text file on the USR-DATA file, state the checksums and return the USR-DATA as a download with the exact same name".

Download the updated USR-DATA and make sure it is named USR-DATA.
Now move the updated USR-DATA to the decrypted save folder.

You could even just upload the edited USR-DATA by itself and tell chatgpt "Calculate the CRC32 of this USR-DATA file in big-endian using the polynomial 0xEDB88320 and initial seed 0xEDCBA987 and final output (~crc) & 0xFFFFFFFF and skipping the first 4 bytes of this file. Then update the first 4 bytes with the CRC32 in big-endian while keeping the exact same filename".

It is also possible to update the checksums offline.
First install python from the microsoft store.

Download this python file and move it to a new folder.
https://github.com/Seaweed47/Battlefield-3-PS3-Save-Editing/blob/main/Bf3_checksum.py
Copy your edited USR-DATA to the same folder as the python file.

Hold shift and right-click the white background within the folder.
Click Open PowerShell window here.
Within Windows PowerShell use the following command: 
python ./Bf3_checksum.py USR-DATA
It will then update the CRC of the USR-DATA.
Now move the updated USR-DATA to the decrypted save folder.
