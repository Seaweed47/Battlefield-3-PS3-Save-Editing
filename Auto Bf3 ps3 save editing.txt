Click green Code button and download as zip.

So we follow this guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDFEXbtOSjA
But no need for battlefield 4 checksum fixer anymore.

Download this text file and upload it to chatgpt.
https://github.com/Seaweed47/Battlefield-3-PS3-Save-Editing/blob/main/Bf3_checksum.txt

Then upload your edited USR-DATA to chatgpt.
Now tell chatgpt "Use the code from the text file on the USR-DATA file, state the checksums and return the USR-DATA as a download with the exact same name".

Download the updated USR-DATA and make sure it is named USR-DATA.
Now move the updated USR-DATA to the decrypted save folder.

It is also possible to update the checksums offline.
First install python from the microsoft store.

Download this python file and move it to a new folder.
https://github.com/Seaweed47/Battlefield-3-PS3-Save-Editing/blob/main/Bf3_checksum.py
Copy your edited USR-DATA to the same folder as the python file.

Hold shift and right-click the white background within the folder.
Click Open PowerShell window here.
Within Windows PowerShell use the following command: 
python ./Bf3_checksum.py USR-DATA
It will then update the CRC of the USR-DATA.
Now move the updated USR-DATA to the decrypted save folder.
